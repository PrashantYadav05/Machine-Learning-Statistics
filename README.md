# Statistics for Machine Learning:

## Logistic Regression Versus Random Forest:

## Tree-Based Machine Learning Models:
* Decision trees - simple model and model with class weight tuning
* Bagging (bootstrap aggregation)
* Random Ffrest - basic random forest and application of grid search on hypyerparameter tuning
* Boosting (AdaBoost, gradient boost, extreme gradient boost - XGBoost)
* Ensemble of ensembles (with heterogeneous and homogeneous models)

## K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes:

## Support Vector Machines

## Recommendation Engines

## Unsupervised Learning
